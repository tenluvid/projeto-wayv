            I know they say that we're too young <br>
            Every day wе're growing <br>
            They say we'rе too dumb <br>
            Problem is that we don't know it <br>
            Anyway, any day, any case, we gon' elevate <br>
            We gon’ make mistakes <br>
            We’ll get there even if it's late <br>

            Young, we wanna celebrate <br>
            Love and we never hesitate <br>
            Hate that we miscommunicate <br>
            Times that we wanna walk away <br>
            Why, why, why, yeah, we play the game? <br>
            Baby, win some, lose some, it’s all the same <br>
        </p>

            Yeah, I could blame it on the rain <br>
            I could blame it on the pain <br>
            I could blame it on my ego <br>
            Put a cross against my name <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            But I'm way up <br>
            And I'm trying to stay up <br>
            I never wanna walk alone <br>
            Just stay here in my zone <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Baby, you know they say that <br>
            Love is all wrong <br>
            It feels so good <br>
            But then you're messed up <br>
            Just put me in the dock <br>
            Yeah, I stand as the accused <br>
            No excuses, yeah, I'm guilty <br>
            Blame it out my <br>

            Maybe I had to lose you <br>
            To know how good I had it <br>
            To know how good that we were <br>
            To know I'm deep in regret (I'm deep in regret) <br>
            Now your surface is cold <br>
            Now you're burnt to the core <br>
            Perfect picture is torn on the floor <br>
            So, I need to tell ya <br>
        </p>
  
        <p>
            All of those lies I told to you <br>
            All of those highs I stole from you <br>
            It was all out of my control <br>
            But I really want you to know the truth <br>
        </p>
